# Newcomer Housing Needs Assessment and Community Action Plan


In 2023, I conducted [a Newcomer Housing Needs Assessment analysis](https://mansomanitoba.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Needs-Assessment-Final-Oct-2023.pdf). This involved engaging with newcomers to the province of Manitoba, particularly in the city of Winnipeg, through individual and group discussions. The goal was to identify the challenges they face when seeking housing. Additionally, I reviewed relevant literature and analyzed data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation.


**Community Action Plan**

Following the Needs Assessment, I collaborated with approximately 20 partner organizations in Winnipeg to develop a [Community Action Plan](https://mansomanitoba.ca/resources/partnerships-for-better-housing-a-newcomer-housing-needs-assessment-by-altered-minds/). This plan outlines strategies for utilizing existing resources more efficiently to address the housing challenges faced by new Canadians. We discovered that improved coordination, closer collaboration, and the formation of new partnerships could significantly enhance our efforts.


**Key Findings and Recommendations:**

Enhanced coordination among organizations
Closer collaboration between stakeholders
Formation of new partnerships to leverage resources
By implementing these strategies, we can make substantial progress in alleviating housing challenges for newcomers in Manitoba.

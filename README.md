# Data-Analysis-Projects

In 2023 I did a [Newcomer Housing Needs Assessment analysis](https://mansomanitoba.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Needs-Assessment-Final-Oct-2023.pdf). In it, I talked with newcomers to the province of Manitoba, and specificlaly the city of Winnipeg, individually and in groups about what challenges they expereinced when looking for housing. I also reviewed literature and analyzed data. 

Following the Needs Assessment, I worked with some 20 partner organizations in Winnipeg to come up with a [Community Action Plan](https://mansomanitoba.ca/resources/partnerships-for-better-housing-a-newcomer-housing-needs-assessment-by-altered-minds/) which outlines how **existing** resources may be used more efficiently to alleviate some of the housing challenges expereinced by new Canadians. It turned out that with more coordination, closer collaboration and the forming of new partnerships, *a lot* can be done.
